# Flicker

Flicker is a multi-disciplinary art project incorporating software engineering practices into the making of performance art.

## Concept

* Live recorded video is cached and projected onto a wall, creating a juxtaposition of current and past events.
* Audio and visual effects are synced to an computer controlled metronome.
* A "Flicker" is a recording of a past event played in the present time.
